<h1><b>Definitions and types</b></h1><hr>
<p>Various definitions of pollution exist, which may or may not recognize certain types, such as <mark>noise pollution or greenhouse gases</mark>. The United States <u> <mark>Environmental Protection Administration</mark></u> defines pollution as<u> "Any substances in water, soil, or air that degrade the natural quality of the environment, offend the senses of sight, taste, or smell, or cause a health hazard. The usefulness of the natural resource is usually impaired by the presence of pollutants and contaminants."</u> In contrast, the United Nations considers pollution to be the "presence of substances and heat in environmental media (air, water, land) whose nature, location, or quantity produces undesirable environmental effects.</p><br>

<h2 style="color:green"> Air pollution  </h2> <hr>
<p> The release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM<sub>10 </sub>to PM<sub>2.5</sub><br>
